Indeo codec AVI's must be played from a local Drive. Microsoft blocks playing from remote network drives.

If media player still won't play the indeo 5 AVI after install of Indeo5setup it’s possible you had the codec already installed, but the registry information wasn’t there
If that’s the problem, run the registry editor. 
Click start, run, regedit. 
Navigate to the key 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers32 

Make sure Drivers32 is selected on the left. On the right scroll down and look for an entry named vidc.iv50 
If it’s not there then click edit, new string value. 
Name it vidc.iv50 then double-click it and for value put ir50_32.dll
